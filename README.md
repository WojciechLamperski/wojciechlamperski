### Hi there 👋

- 🙍‍♂️ I'm Wojciech Lamperski and I aspire to become a junior frontend developer! <br/>
- 🎓 I'm currently studying at [Infoshare Academy](https://infoshareacademy.com/). <br/>
- 🖥️ I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, and I hope to soon do so in a professional environment, to allow me to learn as much as I can and grow as a competent and knowledgeable developer! <br/>
- 🤓 I have a good understanding of Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- ⚛️ Currently, I'm learning React. <br/>
- 🔭 I’m currently working on acquiring a well-rounded knowledge, needed for employment, 
so you will see me adding lots of exercises and homeworks from bootcamp
<br/>
- 📫 You can reach me via my [Infoshare Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wojciech-lamperski/) account.
